            <div class="post-content">
                <p>I&rsquo;ve been playing fast and loose with backups, and I&rsquo;ve been extremely
fortunate to have not suffered any serious system failures or data
loses. I recently recovered from systems failures on my Raspberry Pis
caused by upgrading Debian Buster to Bullseye. The outage wasn&rsquo;t a
because of a bug in Bullseye, the upgrade modified some parameters
<code>/boot/firmware/config.txt</code> which, for some reason, prevented the board
from booting.</p>
<p>Also around the same period, my place was being renovated, and the
construction workers had nicked the main power supply lines. As a
result, we were experiencing some wild voltage fluctuations and power
outages. I thought I burnt my boards from either one of these two
things. It was time to set up a proper backup mechanism.</p>
<h2 id="requirement">Requirement</h2>
<p>I have roughly 3 TB of storage across multiple devices and none of these
were being backed up. Going by the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backup#3-2-1_rule">3-2-1</a>, I would
require at least 9 TB + 3 TB of storage(3*3 + some additional space for
versioned backups &mdash; most backup systems these days are chunk snapshot
systems so versioning is very efficient). But since I&rsquo;m broke and can&rsquo;t
afford offsite storage, my requirements are down to 6 TB + 2 TB.</p>
<h2 id="my-current-solution">My current solution</h2>
<p>I bought two 4 TB disks and setup <a href="https://www.borgbackup.org/">Borg</a>
backup jobs to run at night. I currently have 7 daily, 4 weekly and 4
monthly snapshots on the first disk and the second disk contains 4
weekly and 4 monthly snapshots, and is unplugged and stored at a
different part of the house.</p>
<p>Ideally, it should be plugged in at a different part of the house, away
from my server rack, but I neither have the hardware nor the
infrastructure to implement that.</p>
<h2 id="ideal-solution">Ideal solution</h2>
<p>My current set up will work in most cases. I live in a calm neighborhood
in a very safe city(not prone to natural calamities and such) but
<em>ideally</em> there should be at least one copy of offsite backup. So I did
some math to see how much it would cost me:</p>
<h3 id="aws-s3">AWS S3</h3>
<p>AWS is usually the cheapest and there&rsquo;s probably an adapter available
for Borg</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>pricing:</strong> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/">$0.023/GB-month for the first
50 TB</a></li>
<li><strong>cost:</strong> $0.023 * 3 * 1024 = $70.656/month</li>
</ul>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t like AWS or anything Amazon</p>
<h3 id="tarsnap">Tarsnap</h3>
<p>Tarsnap is developed by <a href="https://www.daemonology.net/blog/">Dr. Colin
Percival</a> and is quite popular.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>pricing:</strong> <a href="https://www.tarsnap.com/">$0.25/GB-month + $0.25/GB
bandwidth</a></li>
<li><strong>cost:</strong> $0.25 * 3 * 1024 = $768/month + bandwidth costs</li>
</ul>
<p>And is also quite expensive!</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t afford either of these solutions. My current setup set cost me
roughly â‚¹16,000 or $220 or the two months worth of AWS rent. Which is
ridiculous. So here&rsquo;s my proposal:</p>
<p>As the internet becomes more diverse and more decentralised, home
servers will become a common thing. This means more folks, like myself,
will be on the lookout for cheap backup and failover solutions.
Normally, these home servers won&rsquo;t be at 100% utilization(I&rsquo;m currently
at 20% across the fleet) so forming rings of trust among friends and
family will be mutually beneficial. This way, the participants within
the ring can rely on each other&rsquo;s facilities for backups and
failover situations for a fraction of what a cloud-based solution would
cost.</p>
<p>Of course, there should be proper measures taken to prevent unauthorized
access and trespassing, but they are implementation details.</p>
