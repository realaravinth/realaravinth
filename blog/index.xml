      <description>We recently got robbed, so we decided to secure the house with some CCTV cameras. Ours is a modest setup with nine 5MP cameras and a DVR recording all the footage from those cameras at 1080p. The DVR can connect to Hikvision&amp;rsquo;s cloud infrastructure so that owners can see live footage using the internet., which I don&amp;rsquo;t like. I mean, in the past few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve moved all my online life from Big Brothers to my servers for privacy reasons, so giving free access to live footage of my house to companies is certainly not acceptable.</description>

      <description>While working on Identity, I noticed some of the endpoints were computationally expensive. The target platforms for Shuttlecraft systems are cheap computers such as Raspberry Pis so I learned a new language and picked up a new web framework among many things, to make things go faster. And those computationally expensive endpoints were dog slow and vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks if left unprotected.
I came up with the following ways to rate-limit those endpoints:</description>

      <description>Matrix is probably the largest federated network in production (Mastadon might be close). I run an instance at https://matrix.batsense.net and I absolutely love it. It was also the project that got me into the whole decentralization thing. I loved the idea that I could run a server that can play along with a bunch of other servers that are run by different parties and they would all somehow magically work!</description>
