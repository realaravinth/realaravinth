            <div class="post-content">
                <p>We recently got robbed, so we decided to secure the house with some CCTV
cameras. Ours is a modest setup with nine 5MP cameras and a DVR
recording all the footage from those cameras at 1080p. The DVR can
connect to Hikvision&rsquo;s cloud infrastructure so that owners can see live
footage using the internet., which I don&rsquo;t like. I mean, in the past few
years, I&rsquo;ve moved all my online life from Big Brothers to my servers for
privacy reasons, so giving free access to live footage of my house to
companies is certainly not acceptable.</p>
<p>So I decided to set up the DVR in an isolated network(without access to
the internet), expose its web interface(the DVR has a web interface) via
a reverse proxy to the internet. This post is an attempt to record my
findings.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using Nginx for reverse proxying. Setting up the reverse proxy
wasn&rsquo;t straightforward. The web interface has many quirks and no
documentation.</p>
<h2 id="first-attempt-simple-reverse-proxy">First Attempt: simple reverse proxy</h2>
<pre><code>server {
    server_name example.com;
    location / {
    	proxy_pass http://dvr-ip-address;
    }
   listen 443 ssl;
   listen 80;
--- snip ---
}
</code></pre><p>This setup exposed the web interface, I was able to log in, but video
playback wasn&rsquo;t working. It would work when I directly access
<code>http://dvr-ip-address</code> but not through the reverse proxy.</p>
<p>I poked around with browser dev tools for a bit and learned that video
was handled by WebSocket connections. And so:</p>
<h2 id="second-attempt-theres-a-websocket-component">Second Attempt: there&rsquo;s a WebSocket component!</h2>
<pre><code>server {
    server_name example.com;
    
    # some static files were taking forever to download
    # so I hooked it up with a cache
    proxy_cache hikvision;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://dvr-ip-address;
        
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        # Ensuring it can use websockets
        proxy_set_header   Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header   Connection &quot;upgrade&quot;;
        proxy_redirect     http:// $scheme://;
        
        # These sets the timeout so that the websocket can stay alive
        proxy_connect_timeout 7m;
        proxy_send_timeout 7m;
        proxy_read_timeout 7m;
    }
    
    listen 443 ssl;
	listen 80;

}
</code></pre><p>Some files were taking forever to download, so I hooked it up with a
cache to speed things up. Video playback wouldn&rsquo;t work even with these
modifications. So I had to dig deeper with the browser dev tools.</p>
<p>Server ports are hardcoded in the frontend application. The DVR system
listens on four ports:</p>
<ul>
<li>WebSocket server for video playback (with and without TLS, separate
ports)</li>
<li>controls, authentication, etc. (with and without TLS, dedicated ports)</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of having the back-end handle HTTP to HTTPS redirection, the
ports are hardcoded in the frontend. The TLS WebSocket server
listens on <code>7682</code> while the plain text WebSocket server listens on
<code>7681</code>. And the frontend, depending on the URI scheme, toggles between
the ports. The reverse proxy had TLS configured, so it was trying to
contact <code>wss://example.com:7682</code>.</p>
<h2 id="third-and-final-attempt-work-already-">Third and Final attempt: work already :/</h2>
<pre><code># server handling configuration, authentication, etc.
server {
    server_name example.com;
    
    proxy_cache hikvision;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://dvr-ip-address;
    }
    
    listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
    listen 80;

}

# websocket server
server {
    server_name example.com;
    listen 7682 ssl;
    
    location / {
        # nginx talks to backend in plain text
        # and hence 7682-7681 plumbing
        proxy_pass http://dvr-ip-address:7681;
        
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        # Ensuring it can use websockets
        proxy_set_header   Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header   Connection &quot;upgrade&quot;;
        proxy_redirect     http:// $scheme://;
        
        # These sets the timeout so that the websocket can stay alive
        proxy_connect_timeout 7m;
        proxy_send_timeout 7m;
        proxy_read_timeout 7m;
    }
    
}
</code></pre><p>I opened port <code>7682</code> on the reverse proxy to
and forward it to port <code>7681</code> on the back-end for video playback and it
works!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>There are a lot of weird things about the Hikvision DVR&rsquo;s web interface.
There was an SSH toggle switch that wouldn&rsquo;t work(I dug up its manual on
the internet, apparently my model doesn&rsquo;t have SSH). The root is not at
<code>/</code> but they have a redirect to <code>/doc/something</code>, which is weird.
There&rsquo;s a separate WebSocket server that listens on a separate port when
they could have simply scoped it to a certain path on the main server.
The web interface is practically useless on mobile devices: video
decoding is done client-side with WASM. So mobile devices struggle to
process feeds from two cameras simultaneously. I understand that these
systems are designed to Just Work™ but software design should be
intuitive and it certainly shouldn&rsquo;t take a whole day to set up a simple
reverse proxy!</p>
