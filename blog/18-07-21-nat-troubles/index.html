            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Couple of days ago, I woke with my inbox filled with alerts from my
<a href="https://stats.uptimerobot.com/EQ7VJHWylx">monitoring service</a>, the
dashboard was lit up like a Christmas tree. I&rsquo;m not new to having
downtimes, but this was the most unusual one: the servers were alright,
the internet connection was fine, but the services were
inaccessible. I had a bad feeling about this one.</p>
<p><img src="/img/blog/18-07-21-NAT-troubles/inbox-nightmare.png" alt="Inbox full of alerts"></p>
<p>You see, most of my internet presence comes out of my bedroom. This
website, my search engine, and even <a href="https://matrix.org">my favourite instant
messaging platform</a> is operated right out of my
bedroom. This has been possible because I&rsquo;ve had a publicly accessible
IP address. It&rsquo;s dynamically allocated but thanks to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_DNS">DDNS</a>, it works! Everything
was fine until my ISP decided to put me behind a NAT. I told them that
I&rsquo;m okay with paying for a static IP, but they said they only offer
static IPs for enterprise accounts. I love my ISP, I think they are
great but a static IP costs â‚¹200/month(~$3) only, but they want me to
upgrade to a plan that costs four times more than what I&rsquo;m paying now.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t buy an enterprise connection and I can&rsquo;t migrate the fleet to
the could because it&rsquo;s expensive, and my parents will disown me. The only
logical option is to switch to an ISP that offers static IPs. But in the
meantime I have set up a tunnel between my servers and a cheap
DigitalOcean box using
<a href="https://github.com/fatedier/frp#rewriting-the-http-host-header"><code>frp</code></a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only been a few hours since the tunnel was set up but so far,
everything seems to be okay. There&rsquo;s a client and a server component,
the client is run on machines behind NAT and the server on a machine
that&rsquo;s exposed to the internet. The client connects to the server and
sets up a reverse tunnel. They support a wide range of protocols
including <code>HTTP</code>, <code>HTTPS</code>, <code>UDP</code> and <code>TCP</code>. Compared to my previous
setup, performance is a little
sluggish, but that&rsquo;s expected since the application now sits behind
two reverse proxies instead of one. But it&rsquo;s usable.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example <code>frpc</code>(<code>frp</code> client) configuration for <code>HTTP</code> and
<code>HTTPS</code>:</p>
