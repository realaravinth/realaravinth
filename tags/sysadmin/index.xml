      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing fast and loose with backups, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been extremely fortunate to have not suffered any serious system failures or data loses. I recently recovered from systems failures on my Raspberry Pis caused by upgrading Debian Buster to Bullseye. The outage wasn&amp;rsquo;t a because of a bug in Bullseye, the upgrade modified some parameters /boot/firmware/config.txt which, for some reason, prevented the board from booting.
Also around the same period, my place was being renovated, and the construction workers had nicked the main power supply lines.</description>

      <description>Matrix is probably the largest federated network in production (Mastadon might be close). I run an instance at https://matrix.batsense.net and I absolutely love it. It was also the project that got me into the whole decentralization thing. I loved the idea that I could run a server that can play along with a bunch of other servers that are run by different parties and they would all somehow magically work!</description>
