      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing fast and loose with backups, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been extremely fortunate to have not suffered any serious system failures or data loses. I recently recovered from systems failures on my Raspberry Pis caused by upgrading Debian Buster to Bullseye. The outage wasn&amp;rsquo;t a because of a bug in Bullseye, the upgrade modified some parameters /boot/firmware/config.txt which, for some reason, prevented the board from booting.
Also around the same period, my place was being renovated, and the construction workers had nicked the main power supply lines.</description>

      <description>Couple of days ago, I woke with my inbox filled with alerts from my monitoring service, the dashboard was lit up like a Christmas tree. I&amp;rsquo;m not new to having downtimes, but this was the most unusual one: the servers were alright, the internet connection was fine, but the services were inaccessible. I had a bad feeling about this one.
You see, most of my internet presence comes out of my bedroom.</description>
