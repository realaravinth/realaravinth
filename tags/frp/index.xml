      <description>Couple of days ago, I woke with my inbox filled with alerts from my monitoring service, the dashboard was lit up like a Christmas tree. I&amp;rsquo;m not new to having downtimes, but this was the most unusual one: the servers were alright, the internet connection was fine, but the services were inaccessible. I had a bad feeling about this one.
You see, most of my internet presence comes out of my bedroom.</description>
