I host a variety of services that are available for anyone to use free
of charge. Below is a list with descriptions of each.


- **[Gotify](https://gotify.batsense.net/)<sup>\*</sup>:** A push
  notification service with support for Linux and Android clients.

- **[Linx](https://linx.batsense.net):** A pastebin-Mozilla Send hybrid.
  Both text(with syntax highlighting) and files can be uploaded to it.

- **[Matrix](https://matrix.batsense.net):** A decentralised chat
  platform that supports the Signal protocol. Learn more about it at
  [matrix.org](https://matrix.org).

- **[Miniflux](https://feeds.batsense.net/)<sup>\*</sup>:** A
  lightweight, web-based feed reader, and an absolute pleasure to use at
  that!

Please note that I am running these services from my home network so
downtimes are unavoidable.
