  aggregating the results of other [search
  engines](https://searx.batsense.net/preferences) while not storing
  information about its users. Learn more about it at its [about

  it at its [about page](https://teddit.bastsense.net/about)

- **[Vikunja](https://tasks.batsense.net/):** A super-charged, Trello
  like todo list manager. It has native clients for both Android and iOS
  but I prefer using the web app as it has more features. Learn more
