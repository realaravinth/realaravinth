I have always fancied writing open letters which are out there but never found.
I know such fantasies are weird but hey, who isn't? So this blog is an attempt
at such a thing.

I won't advertise this blog and the _only_ way it would be discovered is via my
website. Which again, is not advertised. The only place where it gets mentioned
is on my Github profile. And maybe it's existence is implied when send emails
from this domain. The website is unavoidable as I don't have socials and don't
use services like Linkedin so it's necessary for when someone wants to reach
out to me.

That said, here's how this blog is going to work: I will write about stuff that
I ~~bothers me~~ care about. Through this, I'll be giving you a glimpse into my
life. I don't really mind if you discuss the stuff that you read here but I
hope you won't actively share this with people. References for educational
purposes are fine but just not about personal stuff, okay? This blog hopefully
never becomes popular but if it has to, it should happen gradually. Until then,
this will be our little secret. :)
