### Information collected and its purposes

Website activity is logged and stored for a period of one month for
debugging purposes. This information is not shared with anyone nor I
don't run analytics on it.

The following information is collected:

-   **Page URL:** The page URL of each page view on this website. For
    example: _https://batsense.net/contact_
-   **Browser:** Sometimes search engine bots are very aggressive and
    the only way to detect their aggressiveness is by logging
    [User-Agent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent).
    This has the side effect of logging all visitors' User-Agents but
    it's unavoidable.
