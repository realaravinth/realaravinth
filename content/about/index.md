Hello, I'm Aravinth.

I find computers fascinating and making them do a certain thing a
certain way even more fascinating. So I spend most of my time building
and breaking software.


We live in an era where computers and the internet have become an
extension of our lives. The Evil Corps of the internet take advantage of
this by harvesting and selling our data. This is so prevalent that it has
become the industry standard for monetization. And the amount of data that these
organisations collect in exchange for services is alarming.

So I have set out on a mission to build an internet that is decentralised
and invisible to the prying eyes.
