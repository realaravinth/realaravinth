After getting a static IP for my internet connection at home, I decided
I had to get a VPN subscription([Mullvad](https://mullvad.net/en/), not a
paid endorsement; but man, are they fantastic!).

Using the VPN, I was able to "visit" countries. You'd think you'd see
idempotent behavior from websites but, no. They go out of their way to
treat us like crap. See for yourself:

![consent.google.com basic consent form](/img/blog/26-12-2021-gotta-love-europe/consent-google-com-basic.jpg)
> `consent.google.com`? I didn't know Google was capable of saying the C-word

![consent.google.com advance consent
form](/img/blog/26-12-2021-gotta-love-europe/consent-google-com-advance.jpg)
> And they ask consent for YouTube too!

You will be greeted by the above webpage when you visit _any_ Google
website, search included, for the first time. And Google wasn't the only
service that was suddenly privacy-respecting when I switched to Europe.

In my opinion, ad blockers, JavaScript-disabling plugins, and a host of
other privacy tools are only trying to compensate for the lack of good
policy. And sometimes, no matter how good and technically sound the
circumvention mechanisms are, a lack of policies will always come back
to bite us.
