I think definition of basic needs is a little out dated. I mean, a
roof over your head, food on the table, clothes on your back and a bed
to sleep in? They sound like the needs of cattle than that of a
complexed, civilized human.

Here's how I would describe basic needs: the ability to pay for or
acquire decent healthcare, quality family time through vacations and
other means, and self-development(fitness classes, pottery, etc.). I'm
not saying that owning a private yacht and a personal fitness studio
should also be considered basic needs --- that's luxury but letting
off steam once in a while and engaging in creative pursuits are all part
of a healthy, sustainable and happy life, is it not?

Sure, this post might come off as entitled but I think if humanity is able
to meet these needs, we will be free of suffering, gleaming with joy and
have a sense of fulfilment!
