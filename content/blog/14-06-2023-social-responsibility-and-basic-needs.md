As social creatures, our responsibility and our needs
don't just stop at taking care of ourselves. Being nice integral to our
growth and the well-being of our society. So to say that humans need only
leisure and the ability to engage in creative pursuits to sustain
themselves is only partly true.

We need opportunities and the privilege to exercise compassion. Those of
us that are fortunate enough to have enough capital to become
self-reliant must also aim to be a little more than self-sustaining.
So that we can help those in need. It doesn't have to be a lot, but
creating a positive, strong, meaningful impact in someone's life is
critical to reconnect with our humanity and truly realise what it is
like to be human.
