Hello, I'm Aravinth.

I find computers fascinating and making them do a certain thing a
certain way even more fascinating. So I spend most of my time building
and breaking software.

### Contact

You can find me on the [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@realaravinth:matrix.batsense.net),
on [GitHub](https://github.com/realaravinth), at
[realaravinth@batense.net](mailto:realaravinth@batsense.net) and
everywhere wilse with [my PGP Key](./aravinth.asc).

### Disclosure

We live in an era where computers and the internet have become an
extension of our lives. The Evil Corps of the internet take advantage of
this by harvesting and selling our data. This is so prevalent that it has
become the industry standard for monetization. And the amount of data that these
organisations collect in exchange for services is alarming.

So I have set out on a mission to build an internet that is decentralised
and invisible to the prying eyes.

### Services

I host a variety of services that are available for anyone to use free
of charge. Below is a list with descriptions of each.

Please note that I am running these services from my home network so
some downtimes are unavoidable.

- **[Matrix](https://matrix.batsense.net):** A decentralised chat platform
  that supports the Signal protocol. Learn more about it at
  [matrix.org](https://matrix.org).

- **[Gotify](https://gotify.batsense.net/)<sup>\*</sup>:** A push notification
  service with support for Linux and Android clients.

- **[Miniflux](https://feeds.batsense.net/)<sup>\*</sup>:** A lightweight,
  web-based feed reader, and an absolute pleasure to use at that!

- **[Linx](https://linx.batsense.net):** A pastebin-Mozilla Send hybrid.
  Both text(with syntax highlighting) and files can be uploaded to it.

- **[Shiori](https://shiori.batsense.net):** A self-hosted version of
  Mozilla's Pocket. You can save bookmarks, archive webpages and do all
  sorts of things. I don't think it is capable of end-to-end encryption
  though. You can learn more about it at the project's [GitHub
  page](https://github.com/go-shiori/shiori).

  This is a private service so please contact me if you want an
  account.
